            <div>
              <h3>How I changed it</h3>
              <p>
                Inline form validation was changed by making additional check
                validation functions which was called in an addEventListener
                when the input and blur event was triggered. I also disabled the
                button and made an enable button function which was triggered
                when the whole form was validated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shopping cart was implemented in the createHtml function which
                was called in the API fetch function. I made the cart with HTML
                and CSS and rendered the products added to cart into the cart
                array which was stored in the local storage. Each product was
                found by their ID. I made a check to see if the product was
                already in the cart and if it was I made the number of units
                increase for that product instead of duplicating the product for
                each time. I have a remove function to remove an item from the
                cart. I didn't manage to make it work properly, so it removes
                all items instead of the actual product clicked. The cart is
                currently only functionable in the product details page.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the color and size picker on the details page I made two
                forEach loops to loop through the elements and then added an
                eventlistener on click to remove and add the active class which
                I made in CSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The minor changes like Line height, text size, margins, hover
                and colors was changed in the CSS on the specific classes.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Why I did it that way</h3>
              <p>
                I choose to use inline validation to give the user quicker
                feedback on entry by showing a red or green border around the
                input. The submit button is unclickable and with lower opacity
                to show that the fields are required to submit.
              </p>
              <p>
                I made a shopping cart to give a better user experience.
                Shopping cart is a mandatory function for an online store.
              </p>
              <p>
                Color and size pick were made functionable so that the user can
                choose color and size for the product.
              </p>
              <p>
                Line height increased to make the text easier to read and to
                look better.
              </p>
              <p>
                Margins and footer text size were changed to make the design
                more appealing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add to cart button color and hover was changed to make the
                contrast between the different states more visible.

                button and made an enable button function which was triggered
                when the whole form was validated. I added a standard function
                to validate Norwegian phone numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Increased the text size on the logo for desktop view in the
                style CSS.
              </p>
              <p>Hover transform on scale for the logo in CSS.</p>
              <p>

                Increased the logo text to make it more visible in relation to

                that it is clickable. Cursor pointer for the hamburger menu just
                to show its clickable if you for some reason use the mobile view
                on a computer.

              <p>
                Optimized the home page header image in photoshop by resizing it
                in relation to the website usage. Also made the colors in the
                image warmer by using an express function in photoshop.
              </p>
              <p>
                I added the category name for each post by finding the category
                ID for each post and made an if statement for each category ID
                to show a specific category name.
              </p>
              <p>Added smooth scrolling to the HTML in CSS.</p>

                Optimized the carousel by using getBoundingClientRect function
                to find the width of each slide and used the width plus 20px gap
                to move the slider on click. Moving the slider by width px
                instead of %.

                to show that the fields are required to submit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Added validation to subscribe so that fake and wrong subscribers
                would be submitted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Resized the home page header image to make the quality better
                and to show more of the image. Made the color warmer because it
                fits the message of the page and the image better.
              </p>
              <p>
                Displaying the category name in the top of the post so that the
                user know which category they are reading.
              </p>
              <p>
                Smooth scrolling added to make the to top button scroll more
                elegant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Optimized the carousel slider to make it more accurate and to
